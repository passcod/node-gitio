__This is deprecated.__ The [original module] has been updated and is now
what you should use. This module will live on for backward compatibility
as a wrapper on top of the real module, but you should not trust that it
remains alive forever (and indeed the plan is to yank as soon as downloads
reach an acceptable level).
